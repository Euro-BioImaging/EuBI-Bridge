# EuBI-Bridge

EuBI-Bridge is a tool for distributed conversion of microscopic image collections into the OME-Zarr format. 
It can run on the command line or as part of a Python script.  

A key feature of EuBI-Bridge is **aggregative conversion**, which concatenates multiple images along specified dimensions—particularly 
useful for handling large datasets stored as TIFF file collections.  

EuBI-Bridge is built on several powerful libraries, including `zarr`, `bioio`, `dask-distributed` and `tensorstore`, among others. 
Relying on `bioio` plugins for reading, EuBI-Bridge supports a wide range of input file formats.
